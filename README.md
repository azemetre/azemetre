### Hi there 👋

My name is Aaron. I'm a Data Visualization Engineer in the Boston area. Prior to the pandemic you could have found me attending or speaking at the TypeScript, JavaScript, React, Go-lang, or Scala meetups. I'm interested in data visualizations, functional programming, and all types of testing.
