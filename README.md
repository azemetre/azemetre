### Hi there 👋

My name is Aaron. I'm a Data Visualization Engineer in the Boston area. Prior to the pandemic you could have found me attending or speaking at the TypeScript, JavaScript, React, Go, or Scala meetups. I'm interested in data visualizations, functional programming, and all types of testing.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on learning Rust, Go, and Lua
- 🌱 I’m currently trying to be a better (neo)vim user
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on an [a11y cheatsheet](https://github.com/azemetre/web-a11y-cheatsheet)
- 💬 Ask me about testing and data visualizations
- 📫 How to reach me: via twitter [@azemetre](https://twitter.com/azemetre)
